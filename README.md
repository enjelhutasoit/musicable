An iOS app that helps hearing-impaired people to enjoy music through:
- [x] Vibration that help user to feel the rhyme of the song
- [x] Waveform that help user to see the rhyme of the song

## STORY BEHIND THE APP

_Before I and my team built this app, like always, 
we conduct research to find the real problem before we provide a solution choice
using technology._
***
[Music](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music) is a form of art; an expression of emotions through harmonic frequencies. 
Music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like, find interesting or dance to.

Music being such an important and primary needs for people today in terms of pleasures. 

But, how music can be enjoyed by people who can't hear it? How people with hearing-impaired enjoying music? 

Hearing-impaired people do enjoying music but in a different way.
They trying to interpreting the music/song through other senses such as their visual and skin.

To validate our research, we visited several places where hearing-impaired (Teman Tuli) gathers or works e.g in [Finger Talk](https://business.google.com/website/deaf-cafe-fingertalk.org), 
[Kopi Tuli](https://instagram.com/koptul), and [Sunyi Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/sunyi.coffee) and we come with some findings.

Hearing-impaired have a good ability to identify the song by seing the picture of album art; 
to understand the song by reading the lyric; and to feel the rythem through maximize the sound of song
and feel the vibration by putting their hand to the speaker.

In some cases, there is kind of uncomfortable for them to enjoying music in public area cause it can be disturbing other people.

So we came with a solution concept to build an iOS app for hearing-impaired people
to enjoying music through vibration, waveform, and lyric. We named it **Musicable**.
